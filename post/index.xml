      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;s the summer of 2005, all the windows of our house were open (even if we’d be moved to next year) … As a gentle wind wanders through the rooms, that rhythm would never leave my mind, echoes in my ears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time goes by so slowly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s really interesting to find that song playing on the radio and the artist who was singing, but maybe I’ll tell you next time. “Hung-Up” was the song that fascinated me in my 10s after a long struggle to find it. (In the following years, I would be little disappointed to learn that this song&amp;rsquo;s music belongs to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apoetsperspective.com/whos-that-girl-madonna-and-the-philosophy-of-the-self/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ABBA&amp;rsquo;s Gimme Gimme Gimme ;_;&lt;/a&gt;) As you could see, meeting with Madonna -not as old as my dear mother- back to quite a long time. Madonna (the other is King Michael Jackson) is one of the two names that made me love pop music. But Madonna is a queen that contributed me a lot to being me today, not only with her musics but also with her strong stance and philosophy of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she may seem like the last person to be taken as a role model in Turkey, but her &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apoetsperspective.com/whos-that-girl-madonna-and-the-philosophy-of-the-self/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;stance&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.christiantoday.com/article/madonna-talks-about-catholic-church-excommunication-says-she-wanted-to-become-a-nun/102924.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;negativeness&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle, she has an important place in my life and philosophy of life. Madonna is the only person I owe to be healthier, stronger physically and mentally. I could list many more things, but frankly, this article deviates from its purpose. What I want to talk about is how Madonna, -now 62- was able to maintain a discipline she acquired many years ago. In fact, the aim of this article, which I started with no purpose, is what can be said to those who need inspiration and motivation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Madonna is not the only example. But for me it is. A few years ago, Madonna inspired me to stand up in a very troubled period, as in these times. She was saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;m tough, ambitious and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, then okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is exactly one of the quotes that saved my life. (I&amp;rsquo;m serious!) Especially in this geography I live in, it is very difficult to continuing to live as a woman. Sometimes we need such inspiring examples, quote or people. Madonna is exactly that for me. (Maybe for you?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madonna, who is seen by many as a former star who is demented and wants to make a splash again, made a speech to women in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.therushinghour.com/blogs/life/madonna-gives-the-most-powerful-speech-of-2016&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; and ended her speech with the following words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I would like to say to all women here today is this: Women have been so oppressed for so long they believe what men have to say about them. They believe they have to back a man to get the job done. And there are some very good men worth backing, but not because they&amp;rsquo;re men — because they&amp;rsquo;re worthy. As women, we have to start appreciating our own worth and each other&amp;rsquo;s worth. Seek out strong women to befriend, to align yourself with, to learn from, to collaborate with, to be inspired by, to support, and enlightened by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem ironic that someone who utters these words can make a song like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G333Is7VPOg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Papa Don&amp;rsquo;t Preach&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s the only one of its kind among Madonna songs (so we can relax!) I even had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MrvKrt7/status/1423180476072796163?s=20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; about it recently. Still, I can recommend Madonna songs to my fellows (women) who are looking for motivation or want to stay strong. Oh, even I can recommend the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_%28book%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Madonna&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to those who say they are curious about lifestyle and philosophy. (Really)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has wanted to step into the blog world for a long time but could not enter because lack of time and not being able to exceed comfort limit (a strong start for me), I think that my introduction with this short (perhaps aimless?!?) article I wrote about Madonna is an example of the influence of the queen on my life. (Kinda?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I especially must thank Mustafa for his very convincing speeches about writing. Even though I can&amp;rsquo;t write as impressively as &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.tanshaydar.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tanshaydar&lt;/a&gt;, who colors my life with impressive posts, I have been following for a long time. But at least I have experienced the pleasure of writing (otherwise writing is my real job :/). At least, it&amp;rsquo;s a big step for me keeping the blog culture alive, which is up to chin in the pop culture nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world, everyone has their Madonna. But nowadays that many people are two-faced and pretentious, it seems like there is a need for sincere people who hold hard. (One of them, of course, is Madonna, for me of course!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe Madonna can inspire you, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing when I finished: &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/track/5o3M4SZh3McaxwUuW9flhj?si=c2f0dbc0e1804e06&amp;amp;nd=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Madonna – Jump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
