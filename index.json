(In the following years, I would be little disappointed to learn that this song\u0026rsquo;s music belongs to ABBA\u0026rsquo;s Gimme Gimme Gimme ;_;) As you could see, meeting with Madonna -not as old as my dear mother- back to quite a long time. Madonna (the other is King Michael Jackson) is one of the two names that made me love pop music. But Madonna is a queen that contributed me a lot to being me today, not only with her musics but also with her strong stance and philosophy of life.\nAlthough she may seem like the last person to be taken as a role model in Turkey, but her stance against the negativeness, lifestyle, she has an important place in my life and philosophy of life. Madonna is the only person I owe to be healthier, stronger physically and mentally. I could list many more things, but frankly, this article deviates from its purpose. What I want to talk about is how Madonna, -now 62- was able to maintain a discipline she acquired many years ago. In fact, the aim of this article, which I started with no purpose, is what can be said to those who need inspiration and motivation?\nPerhaps Madonna is not the only example. But for me it is. A few years ago, Madonna inspired me to stand up in a very troubled period, as in these times. She was saying:\n“I\u0026rsquo;m tough, ambitious and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, then okay.”\nIt is exactly one of the quotes that saved my life. (I\u0026rsquo;m serious!) Especially in this geography I live in, it is very difficult to continuing to live as a woman. Sometimes we need such inspiring examples, quote or people. Madonna is exactly that for me. (Maybe for you?)\nMadonna, who is seen by many as a former star who is demented and wants to make a splash again, made a speech to women in 2016 and ended her speech with the following words:\n“What I would like to say to all women here today is this: Women have been so oppressed for so long they believe what men have to say about them. They believe they have to back a man to get the job done. And there are some very good men worth backing, but not because they\u0026rsquo;re men — because they\u0026rsquo;re worthy. As women, we have to start appreciating our own worth and each other\u0026rsquo;s worth. Seek out strong women to befriend, to align yourself with, to learn from, to collaborate with, to be inspired by, to support, and enlightened by.”\nIt may seem ironic that someone who utters these words can make a song like Papa Don\u0026rsquo;t Preach, but it\u0026rsquo;s the only one of its kind among Madonna songs (so we can relax!) I even had a tweet about it recently. Still, I can recommend Madonna songs to my fellows (women) who are looking for motivation or want to stay strong. Oh, even I can recommend the book \u0026ldquo;Madonna\u0026rdquo; to those who say they are curious about lifestyle and philosophy. (Really)\n As someone who has wanted to step into the blog world for a long time but could not enter because lack of time and not being able to exceed comfort limit (a strong start for me), I think that my introduction with this short (perhaps aimless?!?) article I wrote about Madonna is an example of the influence of the queen on my life. (Kinda?)\nI especially must thank Mustafa for his very convincing speeches about writing. Even though I can\u0026rsquo;t write as impressively as Tanshaydar, who colors my life with impressive posts, I have been following for a long time. But at least I have experienced the pleasure of writing (otherwise writing is my real job :/). At least, it\u0026rsquo;s a big step for me keeping the blog culture alive, which is up to chin in the pop culture nonsense.\nIn a world, everyone has their Madonna. But nowadays that many people are two-faced and pretentious, it seems like there is a need for sincere people who hold hard. (One of them, of course, is Madonna, for me of course!)\nAnd maybe Madonna can inspire you, too?\nPlaying when I finished: Madonna – Jump\nLicense Copyright 2021 - present Merve KURT\n","date":1628294400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628294400,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://mrvkrt.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2021-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"It's the summer of 2005, all the windows of our house were open (even if we’d be moved to next year).

Indeed,  demanding  education  is  highly  connected  with  gaining  higher income. As a result of this assumption, returns to education is high in most of countries as expected. The empirical findings obtained from this study support and contribute to the literature. Our empirical results suggest proposing that more resources should be allocated in higher education to form higher human capital investment. Based on the  results  of  this  study,  there  was  a  significant  difference  between  the  levels  of education  in  general.  With  technological  developments,  knowledge  and  skills  that individuals need to obtain are increasing while living conditions are changing.","tags":["education","human capital"],"title":"Private Returns to Levels of Education in Turkey: Evidence from Panel Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ {{f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

The paper uses panel econometrics with the Hausman-Taylor and instrumental variable methods dealing with the endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity problems. The private returns on investment in higher education tend to be higher as compared to the private returns on investment in nontertiary education. The results indicate that the private returns on investment from various higher education programs are significantly different across various higher education programs. Based on the empirical findings, a number of policy recommendations are developed.","tags":["education","human capital"],"title":"Returns on Investment in Education: Evidence from Turkey by Education Levels and by Higher Education Programs","type":"publication"}]
