The paper uses panel econometrics with the Hausman-Taylor and instrumental variable methods dealing with the endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity problems. The private returns on investment in higher education tend to be higher as compared to the private returns on investment in nontertiary education. The results indicate that the private returns on investment from various higher education programs are significantly different across various higher education programs. Based on the empirical findings, a number of policy recommendations are developed.","tags":["education","human capital"],"title":"Returns on Investment in Education: Evidence from Turkey by Education Levels and by Higher Education Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Merve KURT","Erdal GUMUS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"260aac4212c1f192cd31e6b103957733","permalink":"https://mrvkrt.github.io/publication/education/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/education/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a common view of literature that increased education investments, as an important human capital determinant, have a positive and significant impact on wage income.  Indeed,  demanding  education  is  highly  connected  with  gaining  higher income. As a result of this assumption, returns to education is high in most of countries as expected. The empirical findings obtained from this study support and contribute to the literature. Our empirical results suggest proposing that more resources should be allocated in higher education to form higher human capital investment. Based on the  results  of  this  study,  there  was  a  significant  difference  between  the  levels  of education  in  general.  With  technological  developments,  knowledge  and  skills  that individuals need to obtain are increasing while living conditions are changing.","tags":["education","human capital"],"title":"Private Returns to Levels of Education in Turkey: Evidence from Panel Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ {{f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?
