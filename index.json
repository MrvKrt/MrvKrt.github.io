The paper uses panel econometrics with the Hausman-Taylor and instrumental variable methods dealing with the endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity problems. The private returns on investment in higher education tend to be higher as compared to the private returns on investment in nontertiary education. The results indicate that the private returns on investment from various higher education programs are significantly different across various higher education programs. Based on the empirical findings, a number of policy recommendations are developed.","tags":["education","human capital"],"title":"Returns on Investment in Education: Evidence from Turkey by Education Levels and by Higher Education Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Merve KURT","Erdal GUMUS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"260aac4212c1f192cd31e6b103957733","permalink":"https://mrvkrt.github.io/publication/education/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/education/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a common view of literature that increased education investments, as an important human capital determinant, have a positive and significant impact on wage income.  Indeed,  demanding  education  is  highly  connected  with  gaining  higher income. As a result of this assumption, returns to education is high in most of countries as expected. The empirical findings obtained from this study support and contribute to the literature. Our empirical results suggest proposing that more resources should be allocated in higher education to form higher human capital investment. Based on the  results  of  this  study,  there  was  a  significant  difference  between  the  levels  of education  in  general.  With  technological  developments,  knowledge  and  skills  that individuals need to obtain are increasing while living conditions are changing.","tags":["education","human capital"],"title":"Private Returns to Levels of Education in Turkey: Evidence from Panel Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mrvkrt.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
